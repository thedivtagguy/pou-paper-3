            Another feature emblematic of Reddit and one which causes me to spend more and more time on it is the thread-based layout of comments. Since Reddit is so focused on providing text content, which is the start of the show, comments can span anywhere from two words to essay-length discussions. This is arranged in a stacked and indented fashion, with each comment having its own series of replies that can go on and on.

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">
            Within each subreddit, there are threads which are essentially posts made by users. Other users can then comment on these threads, and the conversation can branch off in many different directions. The most popular threads rise to the top, and the less popular ones sink to the bottom.

            There are many different types of posts that users can make on Reddit. These include text posts, link posts, image posts, and video posts. There is also a voting system in place so that users can upvote or downvote posts and comments. The most upvoted content rises to the top, while the most downvoted content sinks to the bottom.
