            Reddit awards are a way to create an addictive app. By awarding users for their participation, they are more likely to keep using the app and to keep coming back. This creates a feedback loop of users being awarded and then using the app more, which in turn leads to more awards. The more awards a user has, the more likely they are to keep using Reddit and to tell their friends about it. This creates a virtuous circle of users and awards that can keep people coming back to the app again and again. They also create a sense of community and belonging, as users feel like they are part of something larger and that their participation is valued.
