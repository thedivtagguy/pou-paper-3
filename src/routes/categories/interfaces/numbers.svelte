            Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram use numbers to create addicting content. For example, when someone posts a picture on Instagram, they receive a notification every time someone likes or comments on their photo. The more likes and comments a photo gets, the more likely the person is to keep posting photos.

            Similarly, Reddit uses upvotes and comments to make its app addicting. When someone upvotes a post, it means that they like it and want to see more like it. The more upvotes a post gets, the more likely it is to appear on the front page of Reddit, where it will get even more upvotes. This creates a feedback loop that keeps users coming back to Reddit.

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">
            When I am faced with a long, infinite feed of content the first place where my eyes travel is the upvote counter. More upvotes mean better content, and more comments mean better engagement.  It is a natural filtering mechanism that comes with time, once you start associating the numbers with quality. It is the only indicator that you need. Aside from upvotes, another great indicator of content is the ratio of upvotes to comments. Is something attracting more voices? That is worth paying more attention to.
