Reddit is a website that is made up of user-generated content. The website is organized into different communities, or "subreddits," each of which covers a different topic.

Posts on Reddit are sorted into different categories depending on how popular they are. The "hot" category contains the most popular posts, while the "top" category contains the most upvoted posts. The "controversial" category contains posts that are receiving a lot of downvotes, and the "new" category contains the most recent posts.

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">
            By sorting posts into these different categories, Reddit allows users to more easily find the content they are looking for. Additionally, it creates more opportunities for users to engage with the site by voting on or commenting on posts. This becomes addicting from the perspective of browsing content and keeps users coming back for more.
