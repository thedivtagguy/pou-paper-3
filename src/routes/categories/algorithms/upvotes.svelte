            The upvotes system on Reddit is designed to engage users by encouraging them to vote on the content they find most interesting. The more upvotes a piece of content gets, the more visible it becomes to other users, and the more likely it is to be seen and interacted with. This system encourages users to be active participants in the site, and to share and vote on the content they find most valuable.

        <p class="mt-4 text-gray-500">
            Reddit's upvotes system is designed to make users addicted by giving them a small hit of dopamine every time they get an upvote. This encourages them to keep using the site in order to get more upvotes, and eventually becomes a habit. Over time, they will become more and more addicted to the site and will spend hours browsing it.
